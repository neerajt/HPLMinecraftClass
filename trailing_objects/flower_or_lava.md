# King Midas


```Python
In [1]: import time
In [2]: while True:
...         blockid = 41
...         x, y, z = mc.player.getPos()
...         mc.setBlock(x, y, z, blockid)
...         time.sleep(0.01)
```

Then press enter *two* times to run the code. Go back in the game, run around and then look behind you! You should see gold blocks trailing everywhere you go.
