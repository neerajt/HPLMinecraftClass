# Calling it Home


We can save our Home coordinates by going into our home and calling the `mc.player.getPos()` function, and saving its output to something called a Variable. We can call it whatever we want to, but we should choose a name that will be meaningful to us later on when we want to use it. We'll call it `Home`.
